        pH of honey typically ranges from 3.4 to 6.1, with an average of around 3.9.
        This means that honey is generally acidic. The exact pH can vary depending
        on several factors:\n\n1. Floral source: The type of flowers the bees visited
        to collect nectar can influence the honey''s pH.\n\n2. Geographic location:
        Honey from different regions may have slightly different pH levels due to
        variations in soil and plant species.\n\n3. Processing methods: How the honey
        is extracted and processed can affect its pH.\n\n4. Storage conditions: The
        pH of honey can change slightly over time, especially if not stored properly.\n\n5.
        Moisture content: The amount of water in honey can influence its acidity.\n\nIt''s
        worth noting that the acidity of honey contributes to its antimicrobial properties
        and helps prevent the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms. This is
        one of the reasons why honey has such a long shelf life and has been used
        historically for its preservative qualities."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":14,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":220}}'
